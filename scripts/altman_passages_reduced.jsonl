TITLE: Helion Needs You\nHelion has been progressing even faster than I expected and is on pace in 2024 to 1) demonstrate Q > 1 fusion and 2) resolve all questions needed to design a mass-producible fusion generator.\nThe goals of the company are quite ambitious\u2014clean, continuous energy for 1 cent per kilowatt-hour, and the ability to manufacture enough power plants to satisfy the current electrical demand of earth in a ten year period.\nIf both things happen, it will transform the world. Abundant, clean, and radically inexpensive energy will elevate the quality of life for all of us\u2014think about how much the cost of energy factors into what we do and use. Also, electricity at this price will allow us to do things like efficiently capture carbon (so although we\u2019ll still rely on gasoline for awhile, it\u2019ll be ok).\nAlthough Helion\u2019s scientific progress of the past 8 years is phenomenal and necessary, it is not sufficient to rapidly get to this new energy economy. Helion now needs to figure out how to engineer machines that don\u2019t break, how to build a factory and supply chain capable of manufacturing a machine every day, how to work with power grids and governments around the world, and more.\nThe biggest input to the degree and speed of success at the company is now the talent of the people who join the team.

It discusses DALL\u2022E 2, a new AI tool that can create and edit images based on natural language instructions. The article highlights the potential impact of AI on creative work, the trend of using natural language interfaces with computers, and the challenges and benefits of AI technology in various industries. It also emphasizes the difficulty of predicting the future of AI and raises awareness of both the upsides and downsides of powerful AI models like DALL\u2022E 2. TITLE: DALL\u2022E 2\nToday we did a research launch of DALL\u2022E 2, a new AI tool that can create and edit images from natural language instructions. \nMost importantly, we hope people love the tool and find it useful. For me, it\u2019s the most delightful thing to play with we\u2019ve created so far. I find it to be creativity-enhancing, helpful for many different situations, and fun in a way I haven\u2019t felt from technology in a while.\nBut I also think it\u2019s noteworthy for a few reasons:\n1) This is another example of what I think is going to be a new computer interface trend: you say what you want in natural language or with contextual clues, and the computer does it. We offer this for code and now image generation; both of these will get a lot better. But the same trend will happen in new ways until eventually it works for complex tasks\u2014we can imagine an \u201cAI office worker\u201d that takes requests in natural language like a human does.\n2) It sure does seem to \u201cunderstand\u201d concepts at many levels and how they relate to each other in sophisticated ways.\n3) Copilot is a tool that helps coders be more productive, but still is very far from being able to create a full program. DALL\u2022E 2 is a tool that will help artists and illustrators be more creative, but it can also create a \u201ccomplete work\u201d. This may be an early example of the impact AI on labor markets. Although I firmly believe AI will create lots of new jobs, and make many existing jobs much better by doing the boring bits well, I think it\u2019s important to be honest that it\u2019s increasingly going to make some jobs not very relevant (like technology frequently does).\n4) It\u2019s a reminder that predictions about AI are very difficult to make. A decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that AI would first impact physical labor, and then cognitive labor, and then maybe someday it could do creative work. It now looks like it\u2019s going to go in the opposite order.\n5) It\u2019s an example of a world in which good ideas are the limit for what we can do, not specific skills.\n6) Although the upsides are great, the model is powerful enough that it's easy to imagine the downsides.\nHopefully this summer, we\u2019ll do a product launch and people will be able to use it for all sorts of things. We wanted to start with a research launch to figure out how to minimize the downsides in collaboration with a larger group of researchers and artists, and to give people some time to adapt to the change\u2014in general, we are believers in incremental deployment strategies.

Helion is by far the most promising approach to fusion I\u2019ve seen.\nDavid and Chris are two of the most impressive founders and builders (in the sense of building fusion machines, in addition to building companies!) I have ever met, and they have done something remarkable.

Helion has a clear path to net electricity by 2024, and has a long-term goal of delivering electricity for 1 cent per kilowatt-hour.

TITLE: The Strength of Being Misunderstood\nA founder recently asked me how to stop caring what other people think. I didn\u2019t have an answer, and after reflecting on it more, I think it's the wrong question.\nAlmost everyone cares what someone thinks (though caring what everyone thinks is definitely a mistake), and it's probably important. Caring too much makes you a sheep. But you need to be at least a little in tune with others to do something useful for them.\nIt seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1 but the latter doesn\u2019t seem to get much attention.\nThe most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldn\u2019t value (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters). But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other people\u2019s opinions on a very long time horizon\u2014as long as the history books get it right, they take some pride in letting the newspapers get it wrong. \nYou should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet. But there are lots of other ways\u2013the key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness.

It discusses the key factors that contributed to the success of YC, primarily the role of its founders, Paul Graham (PG) and Jessica Livingston. The article highlights their belief in unknown individuals, their strong norms and defense against bad behavior, their trust in their own convictions, and their willingness to be disliked by existing power structures. It emphasizes the importance of community, long-term orientation, and building an ecosystem rather than being solely focused on financial gain. However, the article acknowledges that replicating YC's success has been challenging for others in the industry. TITLE: PG and Jessica\nA lot of people want to replicate YC in some other industry or some other place or with some other strategy. In general, people seem to assume that: 1) although there was some degree of mystery or luck about how YC got going, it can\u2019t be that hard, and 2) if you can get it off the ground, the network effects are self-sustaining.\nMore YC-like things are good for the world; I generally try to be helpful. But almost none of them work. People are right about the self-sustaining part, but they can\u2019t figure out how to get something going.\nThe entire secret to YC getting going was PG and Jessica\u2014there was no other magic trick. A few times a year, I end up in a conversation at a party where someone tells a story about how much PG changed their life\u2014people speak with more gratitude than they do towards pretty much anyone else. Then everyone else agrees, YC founders and otherwise (non-YC founders might talk about an impactful essay or getting hired at a YC company). Jessica still sadly doesn\u2019t get nearly the same degree of public credit, but the people who were around the early days of YC know the real story.\nWhat did they do? They took bets on unknown people and believed in them more than anyone had before. They set strong norms and fought back hard against bad behavior towards YC founders. They trusted their own convictions, were willing to do things their way, and were willing to be disliked by the existing power structures. They focused on the most important things, they worked hard, and they spent a huge amount of time 1:1 with people. They understood the value of community and long-term orientation. When YC was very small, it felt like a family.\nPerhaps most importantly, they built an ecosystem (thanks to Joe Gebbia for pointing this out). This is easy to talk about but hard to do, because it requires not being greedy. YC has left a lot of money on the table; other people have made more money from the ecosystem than YC has itself. This has cemented YC\u2019s place\u2014the benefits to the partners, alumni, current batch founders, Hacker News readers, Demo Day investors, and everyone else around YC is a huge part of what makes it work.\nI am not sure if any of this is particularly useful advice\u2014none of it sounds that hard, and yet in the 15 years since, it hasn\u2019t been close to replicated.\nBut it seems worth trying.

As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this, and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless you\u2019d be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves).\nThey have a bias towards action and trying things, and they\u2019re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn\u2019t (importantly, this goes both ways\u2014I\u2019m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it). \nThey are creative idea-generators\u2014a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.\nThey really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they don\u2019t think make sense.

{"prompt": "Analyze the post, learn its insights, and think about how to replicate the author's writing. The following article may be helpful for aspiring entrepreneurs or individuals looking to generate new ideas. It discusses the importance of idea generation for startup founders and provides tips on how to improve your idea generation skills. The article emphasizes the importance of being in the right environment and surrounding yourself with people who have a high idea flux and think creatively. It also encourages thinking about future trends and identifying opportunities that come with tectonic shifts in the world. TITLE: Idea Generation\nThe most common question prospective startup founders ask is how to get ideas for startups. The second most common question is if you have any ideas for their startup.\nBut giving founders an idea almost always doesn\u2019t work. Having ideas is among the most important qualities for a startup founder to have\u2014you will need to generate lots of new ideas in the course of running a startup.\nYC once tried an experiment of funding seemingly good founders with no ideas. I think every company in this no-idea track failed. It turns out that good founders have lots of ideas about everything, so if you want to be a founder and can\u2019t get an idea for a company, you should probably work on getting good at idea generation first.\nHow do you do that?\nIt\u2019s important to be in the right kind of environment, and around the right kind of people. You want to be around people who have a good feel for the future, will entertain improbable plans, are optimistic, are smart in a creative way, and have a very high idea flux. These sorts of people tend to think without the constraints most people have, not have a lot of filters, and not care too much what other people think. \nThe best ideas are fragile; most people don\u2019t even start talking about them at all because they sound silly. Perhaps most of all, you want to be around people who don\u2019t make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea, and who certainly never feel stupid for doing so themselves.\nStay away from people who are world-weary and belittle your ambitions. Unfortunately, this is most of the world. But they hold on to the past, and you want to live in the future.\nYou want to be able to project yourself 20 years into the future, and then think backwards from there. Trust yourself\u201420 years is a long time; it\u2019s ok if your ideas about it seem pretty radical. \nAnother way to do this is to think about the most important tectonic shifts happening right now. How is the world changing in fundamental ways? Can you identify a leading edge of change and an opportunity that it unlocks? The mobile phone explosion from 2008-2012 is the most recent significant example of this\u2014we are overdue for another!\nIn such a tectonic shift, the world changes so fast that the big incumbents usually get beaten by fast-moving and focused startups. (By the way, it\u2019s useful to get good at differentiating between real trends and fake trends. A key differentiator is if the new platform is used a lot by a small number of people, or used a little by a lot of people.)\nAny time you can think of something that is possible this year and wasn\u2019t possible last year, you should pay attention. You may have the seed of a great startup idea. This is especially true if next year will be too late.\nWhen you can say \u201cI am sure this is going to happen, I\u2019m just not sure if we\u2019ll be the ones to do it\u201d, that\u2019s a good sign. Uber was like this for me\u2014after the first time I used it, it was clear we weren\u2019t going to be calling cabs for that much longer, but I wasn\u2019t sure that Uber was going to win the space.\nA good question to ask yourself early in the process of thinking about an idea is \u201ccould this be huge if it worked?\u201d There are many good ideas in the world, but few of them have the inherent advantages that can make a startup massively successful. Most businesses don\u2019t generate a valuable accumulating advantage as they scale. Think early about why an idea might have that property. It\u2019s obvious for Facebook or Airbnb, but it often exists in more subtle ways.\nIt\u2019s also important to think about what you\u2019re well-suited for. This is hard to do with pure introspection; ideally you can ask a mentor or some people you\u2019ve worked with what you\u2019re particularly good at. I\u2019ve come to believe that founder/company fit is as important as product/market fit.\nFinally, a good test for an idea is if you can articulate why most people think it\u2019s a bad idea, but you understand what makes it good.\n\nThis is from my notes for a talk I gave at a YC event in China in 2018. Thanks to Eric Migicovsky for encouraging me to post it!\nI wrote it when I thought mostly about startups; now I think mostly about AI development.

It also emphasizes the significance of having a long-term commitment and ambitious vision for the startup. TITLE: Hard Startups\nThe most counterintuitive secret about startups is that it\u2019s often easier to succeed with a hard startup than an easy one.  A hard startup requires a lot more money, time, coordination, or technological development than most startups. A good hard startup is one that will be valuable if it works (not all hard problems are worth solving!).\nI remember when Instagram started to get really popular\u2014it felt like you couldn\u2019t go a day without hearing about another photo sharing startup.  That year, probably over 1,000 photo sharing startups were funded, while there were fewer than ten nuclear fusion startups in existence.\nEasy startups are easy to start but hard to make successful.  The most precious commodity in the startup ecosystem right now is talented people, and for the most part talented people want to work on something they find meaningful.\nA startup eventually has to get a lot of people to join its quest.  It\u2019s usually reasonably easy to get the first five or ten people to join\u2014you can offer large equity grants and areas of responsibility.  But eventually, what you have to recruit with are the mission of the company, the likelihood of massive success, and the quality of the people there. [1\nFew recruiting messages are as powerful (when true) as \u201cthe world needs this, it won\u2019t happen any time soon if we don\u2019t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don\u2019t join.\u201d\nThere is a derivative of the Peter Principle at play here\u2014your startup will rise to the level where it can no longer attract enough talented people.  (This sometimes holds true for careers too\u2014the limiting factor for many careers eventually becomes how many talented people you know and can get to work with you.)\nAn easy startup is a headwind; a hard startup is a tailwind.  If people care about your success because you seem committed to doing something significant, it\u2019s a background force helping you with hiring, advice, partnerships, fundraising, etc.\nPart of the magic of Silicon Valley is that people default to taking you seriously if you\u2019re willing to be serious\u2014they\u2019ve learned it\u2019s a very expensive mistake, in aggregate, not to.  If you want to start a company working on a better way to build homes, gene editing, artificial general intelligence, a new education system, or carbon sequestration, you may actually be able to get it funded, even if you don\u2019t have a degree or much experience. \nLet yourself become more ambitious\u2014figure out the most interesting version of where what you\u2019re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step. You don\u2019t want step one to be incorporating the company and step two to be going to Mars.\nBe willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you\u2019re doing.  Most people aren\u2019t, which is part of the reason they pick \u201ceasy\u201d startups.  In a world of compounding advantages where most people are operating on a 3 year timeframe and you\u2019re operating on a 10 year timeframe, you\u2019ll have a very large edge.\n\n Thanks to Luke Miles for reviewing drafts of this.\n[1 Another solution to this problem is to think about startups that can become quite successful with less than ten people.

{"prompt": "Engage with the post, learn its essence, and deliberate on writing in a similar manner to the author. The following article may be helpful for individuals who are interested in investing in startups. It provides insights and tips on how to be a successful startup investor, including how to gain access to good investment opportunities, make informed investment decisions, and establish a strong network in the startup ecosystem. It also emphasizes the importance of working hard, helping others, and developing a brand as an investor. TITLE: How To Invest In Startups\nThere is a lot of advice about how to be a good startup founder.  But there isn\u2019t very much about how to be a good startup investor.\nBefore going any further, I should point out that this is a particularly hard time to invest in startups\u2014it\u2019s easier right now to be a capital-taker than a capital-giver.  It seems that more people want to be investors than founders, and that there\u2019s an apparent never-ending flow of capital looking for access to startups.\nThe law of supply and demand has done its thing.   Valuations have risen, and the best investment opportunities are flooded with interest.  As a friend of mine recently observed, \u201cit\u2019s much easier to get LPs to give you money for your seed fund than it is to get a meaningful allocation in a \u2018hot deal\u2019\u201d.\nThat said, to do well as an investor, you need to do three things: get access to good investment opportunities, make good decisions about what to invest in, and get the companies you want to invest in to choose you as an investor.  That\u2019s it! You can often help the companies you invest in become bigger than they otherwise would have been, but the sad reality is that your best investments will do quite well without you.\nAccess\nGetting access to investment opportunities is the easiest of the three categories: you can just work hard.  It\u2019s surprising that most investors don\u2019t work hard, but it\u2019s true, and a bug that you can exploit.\nPutting a lot of energy into networking actually works, as long as you aren\u2019t just trying to touch base when people can find some time away from their crazy calendars to grab coffee.  If you actually figure out how to help other investors you respect, and to really help good founders, then good investment opportunities will come your way.\nIf you\u2019re starting out as a full-time investor, make it your full-time job to figure out how to help people that will become your future investment-sourcing network.  Instead of just asking your contacts to tell you about investment opportunities, ask them if you can spend a day per week helping their best company. In general, early-stage investors can help a lot with closing candidates, future fundraising, customer introductions, and generic advice.\nA brand is the other way to get access.  There are a lot of ways to build one, but by the same principle of working hard, a good example is to write long-form content (hard, few people do a good job at it) instead of tweeting (easy, everyone does a pretty good job at it). \nDecisions\nGreat founders are the key to great startups.  One way to do really well as a startup investor is to get good at predicting who is going to be great before they are\u2014the market rewards finding great but inexperienced people.  You can also do well by investing in people who are already proven, but the price of the shares you buy will reflect that.\nSo how do you identify future greatness?\nIt\u2019s easiest if you get to meet people in person, several times.  If you meet someone three times in three months, and notice detectable improvement each time, pay attention to that.  The rate of improvement is often more important than the current absolute ability (in particular, younger founders can sometimes improve extremely quickly).\nThe main question I ask myself when I meet a founder is if I\u2019d work for that person.  The second question I ask myself is if I can imagine them taking over their industry.\nI look for founders who are scrappy and formidable at the same time (a rarer combination than it sounds); mission-oriented, obsessed with their companies, relentless, and determined; extremely smart (necessary but certainly not sufficient); decisive, fast-moving, and willful; courageous, high-conviction, and willing to be misunderstood; strong communicators and infectious evangelists; and capable of becoming tough and ambitious. \nSome of these characteristics seem to be easier to change than others; for example, I have noticed that people can become much tougher and more ambitious rapidly, but people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to change.  Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails.\nAlso, it sounds obvious, but the successful founders I\u2019ve funded believe they are eventually certain to be successful.\nIn addition to learning to predict who will become great founders, you have to be at least okay at predicting what markets will be good.\nStartups are likely to happen in many more industries\u2014startups can win wherever costs can be low and cycle time can be fast.  Startups do particularly well in industries with rapid technological change, because their fundamental advantages over large competitors are speed and focus.  A higher rate of change gives startups more opportunities to be right and the large competitor more opportunities to stumble.\nLike the founder, and like a company, what you should care about is the growth rate and eventual size of a market (I don\u2019t know why most investors are so obsessed with the current size of a market instead of how big they think it will be in ten years, but it\u2019s an opportunity for you).\nThe best companies tend to have the courage to lead the market by a couple of years, but they know the secret for telling the difference between a real trend and a fake trend.  For a real trend, even if there aren\u2019t many users, they use the new platform a lot and love it. For example, although the iPhone was derided for not having many users in its first year or two, most people who had an iPhone raved about it in a way that they never did about previous smartphones.\nThe very best companies tend to ride the wave of a new, important, and rapidly growing platform.\nThe spectral signatures of the best companies I\u2019ve invested in are remarkably similar.  They usually have most of the following characteristics: compelling founders, a mission that attracts talented people into the startup\u2019s orbit, a product so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, a rapidly growing market, a network effect and low marginal costs, the ability to grow fast, and a product that is either fundamentally new or 10x better than existing options.\nYou should try to limit yourself to opportunities that could be $10 billion companies if they work (which means they have, at least, a fast-growing market and some sort of pricing power).  The power law is that powerful. This is easy to say and hard to do, and I\u2019ve been guilty of violating the principle many times. But the data are clear\u2014the failures don\u2019t matter much, the small successes don\u2019t matter much, and the giant returns are where everything happens.\nThe central learning of my career so far has been that you can and should scale up things that are working.  The power of scale, and the emergent behavior that sometimes comes from it, is tremendous. I think about the potential energy of future scale for every investment I make.  Most people seem terrible at this, so it\u2019s another bug you can exploit.  \nAlthough good ideas are understandably seductive, for early-stage investing they are mostly valuable as a way to identify good founders.  However, sometimes bad founders have good ideas too, and investing in them is the chronic investing mistake that has been hardest for me to correct.  (My second biggest chronic mistake has been chasing investments primarily because other investors like them.)\nClose rate\nThe better the investment opportunity is (i.e., expected value relative to valuation), the harder it usually is to get the company to choose you as an investor.\nTraditional sales tactics works pretty well here.  Spend a lot of time with the founder, explain what you\u2019re willing to do to help them, ask founders you\u2019ve worked with in the past to call them, etc. \nA reputation for being above-and-beyond helpful and accessible is worth a lot here, and rare among all but the best investors.  A reputation for being founder-friendly helps too. What helps most of all is other founders you\u2019ve previously invested in saying \u201cthat person was my best investor by far\u201d.\nIn addition to helping get access to investment opportunities, a strong brand also helps close them.  It\u2019s a nice tailwind if you can get yourself to the place where simply taking your money helps a company get taken more seriously.\nDecisiveness also helps\u2014everyone wants to be wanted, and most investors wait for someone else to act first.  If you decide quickly, and especially if you decide before others do, founders tend to appreciate that. The two most recent significant investments I made were 1) telling people I\u2019d previously backed and had huge conviction in that I would do their Series A before they finished telling me what their idea was, and 2) offering to do the seed round of founders I\u2019d never met before at the end of a one hour meeting.  I don\u2019t recommend doing that very often, but when your conviction is strong, let it show.   \nThe best way to have a poor close rate is to not treat founders like peers.  If you\u2019re picking well, you should be investing in founders that you think of as your peers at least.  Founders have a sixth sense for who is going to treat them like a peer and who is going to treat them like a boss.  And if they\u2019re good, they know you\u2019re failing an intelligence test if you act like their boss.\nHelp them\nThe most important way to help founders is to get them to be more ambitious\u2014to think bigger and to have more self-belief.  Help them set ambitious but achievable goals. Momentum is important and self-reinforcing\u2014most people set goals that they expect to be just out of reach, which is usually demotivating.  It\u2019s better to continuously set goals that you can just barely hit.\nThe second most important thing to do is to give them specific, tactical advice (instead of general strategy) about how to achieve their goals.  Good tactical advice is something like \u201cit seems like you\u2019ve figured out yourself how to do sales for this company, so here is where to look and what to look for in your first sales hire, and here is the sales tool you should use\u201d.\nThere are a lot of specific things you can do to help\u2014make introductions, help them hire, help them find other investors, help them find an office, etc.\u2014but generally you should wait to do these until asked. \nA big exception is that you should proactively let them know when you have very high conviction that they\u2019re about to make a big mistake, especially once things are working and they aren\u2019t setting themselves up to scale.\nIn theory, another big exception is actually helping founders come up with good new ideas.  The first investor I ever watched in action was PG and so I assumed this was something all investors were fantastic at.  But it turns out he is a sui generis idea generator, and even most great investors are usually still bad at telling founders what to work on.  It\u2019s worth trying to be self-aware.\nFinally, I\u2019ve found that most of the time when founders call asking for vague help, what they are really asking for is emotional support from a friend.  Invite them over to your house, make them tea or pour them a drink, and start listening to their struggles.\n\n\n\nThanks to Jack Altman, Max Altman, and Luke Miles for reviewing drafts of this.", "completion": "This is the 13th completion"}

TITLE: Reinforcement Learning Progress\nToday, OpenAI released a new result.  We used PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), a general reinforcement learning algorithm invented by OpenAI, to train a team of 5 agents to play Dota and beat semi-pros.\nThis is the game that to me feels closest to the real world and complex decision making (combining strategy, tactics, coordinating, and real-time action) of any game AI had made real progress against so far.\nThe agents we train consistently outperform two-week old agents with a win rate of 90-95%.  We did this without training on human-played games\u2014we did design the reward functions, of course, but the algorithm figured out how to play by training against itself.\nThis is a big deal because it shows that deep reinforcement learning can solve extremely hard problems whenever you can throw enough computing scale and a really good simulated environment that captures the problem you\u2019re solving.  We hope to use this same approach to solve very different problems soon.  It's easy to imagine this being applied to environments that look increasingly like the real world.\nThere are many problems in the world that are far too complex to hand-code solutions for.  I expect this to be a large branch of machine learning, and an important step on the road towards general intelligence.", "completion": "This is the 14th completion"}
{"prompt": "Read the article thoroughly, understand its points, and reflect on how to mimic the author's writing. <<UNDER 500 WORDS>> The following article may be helpful for individuals interested in cryptocurrency or those who are curious about the potential impact of digital currencies on governments. It discusses the possibility of the US government creating its own digital currency (\"USDC\") and addresses the challenges and advantages of such a move. The article explores how a government-issued digital currency could address issues of anonymity, function as a legal currency, and facilitate taxation. It also touches upon the potential benefits and implications for both the government and cryptocurrency users. TITLE: US Digital Currency\nI am pretty sure cryptocurrency is here to stay in some form (at least as a store of value, which is the only use case we have seen work at scale so far).  There was possibly a time when governments could have totally stopped it, but it feels like that\u2019s in the rearview mirror.\nHowever, I think it\u2019s very possible that the dominant cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t been created yet (Google was years late to the search engine party, and Facebook came long after most people assumed the social network wars were won).  And from the perspective of a nation, there are real problems with current systems, especially around pseudo-anonymity, ability to function as an actual currency, and taxability.\nAlthough I don\u2019t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner\u2013let\u2019s call it \u201cUSDC\u201d for US Digital Currency\u2013and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency.\nI think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency.\nThe US government could decide to treat USDC as a second legal currency, which would be hugely powerful.  (I think the US doing this would be significantly more impactful than the smaller governments thinking about it now.)\nIdeally the initial coins would be evenly distributed to US citizens and taxpayers\u2014something like everyone with a social security number gets two coins, one that is immediately sellable and one that you have to keep for 10 years.\nUSDC could require that certain transaction can only happen with wallets with known owners.  It could even build a tax system into the protocol.\nA tricky part of this would be how to balance letting the network have control over itself and letting the government have some special degree of input on \u2018monetary policy\u2019.  It\u2019s certainly ok for the government to have some, but I think the network needs to be mostly in charge (e.g., the government couldn\u2019t be allowed to arbitrarily inflate the currency when it wanted to).\nThe current practices seem to be for governments to mostly ignore cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to mostly ignore government, which seems to me to be unsustainable in both directions.  But I believe there exists a middle ground where the government can get a lot of what it wants, and cryptocurrency users can get a lot of what they want too.\nThe government can likely create a lot of de novo wealth for its citizens in the process.", "completion": "This is the 15th completion"}
{"prompt": "Study the post attentively, learn from it, and consider how to parallel the author's style in your writing The following article may be helpful for individuals who are looking to improve their productivity levels. It provides tips and insights on how to optimize productivity, including the importance of choosing the right tasks to work on, developing independent thought, and delegating tasks effectively. It also emphasizes the significance of finding work that aligns with one's interests and passions, as well as surrounding oneself with positive and inspiring individuals. TITLE: Productivity\nI think I am at least somewhat more productive than average, and people sometimes ask me for productivity tips.  So I decided to just write them all down in one place.\nCompound growth gets discussed as a financial concept, but it works in careers as well, and it is magic.  A small productivity gain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.  So it\u2019s worth figuring out how to optimize productivity. If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive. \nWhat you work on\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how fast you move if it\u2019s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!  Independent thought is hard but it\u2019s something you can get better at with practice.\nThe most impressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in the general population.  If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever you last spoke with, that\u2019s bad.  You will of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with your convictions.  It will let you be courageous when you\u2019re right about something important that most people don\u2019t see.\nI make sure to leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best ways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people, and spending time in nature.\nI\u2019ve learned that I can\u2019t be very productive working on things I don\u2019t care about or don\u2019t like.  So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do them (by delegating, avoiding, or something else).  Stuff that you don\u2019t like is a painful drag on morale and momentum.\nBy the way, here is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also most productive when they\u2019re doing what they like, and do what you\u2019d want other people to do for you\u2014try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what, and delegate that way.  \nIf you find yourself not liking what you\u2019re doing for a long period of time, seriously consider a major job change.  Short-term burnout happens, but if it isn\u2019t resolved with some time off, maybe it\u2019s time to do something you\u2019re more interested in. \nI\u2019ve been very fortunate to find work I like so much I\u2019d do it for free, which makes it easy to be really productive.\nIt\u2019s important to learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better quickly.  This feels like an unlikely miracle the first few times it happens, but eventually you learn to trust that you can do it.\nDoing great work usually requires colleagues of some sort.  Try to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people that don\u2019t belittle your ambitions.  I love being around people who push me and inspire me to be better.  To the degree you able to, avoid the opposite kind of people\u2014the cost of letting them take up your mental cycles is horrific. \nYou have to both pick the right problem and do the work.  There aren\u2019t many shortcuts.  If you\u2019re going to do something really important, you are very likely going to work both smart and hard.  The biggest prizes are heavily competed for.  This isn\u2019t true in every field (there are great mathematicians who never spend that many hours a week working) but it is in most.\nPrioritization\nMy system has three key pillars: \u201cMake sure to get the important shit done\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t waste time on stupid shit\u201d, and \u201cmake a lot of lists\u201d.\nI highly recommend using lists.  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day.  Lists are very focusing, and they help me with multitasking because I don\u2019t have to keep as much in my head.  If I\u2019m not in the mood for some particular task, I can always find something else I\u2019m excited to do.\nI prefer lists written down on paper.  It\u2019s easy to add and remove tasks.  I can access them during meetings without feeling rude.  I re-transcribe lists frequently, which forces me to think about everything on the list and gives me an opportunity to add and remove items.\nI don\u2019t bother with categorization or trying to size tasks or anything like that (the most I do is put a star next to really important items).  \nI try to prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the better I feel, and then the more I get done.  I like to start and end each day with something I can really make progress on.\nI am relentless about getting my most important projects done\u2014I\u2019ve found that if I really want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens. \nI try to be ruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the quickest way possible.  I probably take this too far\u2014for example, I am almost sure I am terse to the point of rudeness when replying to emails.\nI generally try to avoid meetings and conferences as I find the time cost to be huge\u2014I get the most value out of time in my office.  However, it is critical that you keep enough space in your schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure to new people and ideas.  Having an open network is valuable; though probably 90% of the random meetings I take are a waste of time, the other 10% really make up for it.\nI find most meetings are best scheduled for 15-20 minutes, or 2 hours.  The default of 1 hour is usually wrong, and leads to a lot of wasted time.\nI have different times of day I try to use for different kinds of work.  The first few hours of the morning are definitely my most productive time of the day, so I don\u2019t let anyone schedule anything then.  I try to do meetings in the afternoon.  I take a break, or switch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade. \nI don\u2019t think most people value their time enough\u2014I am surprised by the number of people I know who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something they don\u2019t want to do to save $20.\nAlso, don\u2019t fall into the trap of productivity porn\u2014chasing productivity for its own sake isn\u2019t helpful.  Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly optimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they\u2019re working on the right problems.  It doesn\u2019t matter what system you use or if you squeeze out every second if you\u2019re working on the wrong thing.\nThe right goal is to allocate your year optimally, not your day.\nPhysical factors\nVery likely what is optimal for me won\u2019t be optimal for you.  You\u2019ll have to experiment to find out what works best for your body.  It\u2019s definitely worth doing\u2014it helps in all aspects of life, and you\u2019ll feel a lot better and happier overall.\nIt probably took a little bit of my time every week for a few years to arrive at what works best for me, but my sense is if I do a good job at all the below I\u2019m at least 1.5x more productive than if not.\nSleep seems to be the most important physical factor in productivity for me.  Some sort of sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful.  I\u2019ve found the only thing I\u2019m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I really like the Emfit QS+Active.\nI like a cold, dark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on a great mattress for years, which was stupid\u2014it makes a huge difference to my sleep quality.  I love this one).  Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep helps.  Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though I\u2019m not willing to do that all the time.\nI use a Chili Pad to be cold while I sleep if I can\u2019t get the room cold enough, which is great but loud (I set it up to have the cooler unit outside my room).\nWhen traveling, I use an eye mask and ear plugs.\nThis is likely to be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a normal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can\u2019t sleep.  I am a bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel.  It likely has tradeoffs, but so does not sleeping well.  If you can already sleep well, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this.\nI use a full spectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on email.  It\u2019s great\u2014if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I\u2019d try.  It\u2019s a ridiculous gain for me.  I like this one, and it\u2019s easy to travel with.\nExercise is probably the second most important physical factor.  I tried a number of different exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best was lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval training occasionally.  In addition to productivity gains, this is also the exercise program that makes me feel the best overall.  \nThe third area is nutrition.  I very rarely eat breakfast, so I get about 15 hours of fasting most days (except an espresso when I wake up).  I know this is contrary to most advice, and I suspect it\u2019s not optimal for most people, but it definitely works well for me.\nEating lots of sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I don\u2019t have much willpower when it comes to sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house.\nI have one big shot of espresso immediately when I wake up and one after lunch.  I assume this is about 200mg total of caffeine per day.  I tried a few other configurations; this was the one that worked by far the best.  I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if I\u2019m super tired and really need to get something done.\nI\u2019m vegetarian and have been since I was a kid, and I supplement methyl B-12, Omega-3, Iron, and Vitamin D-3.  I got to this list with a year or so of quarterly blood tests; it\u2019s worked for me ever since (I re-test maybe every year and a half or so).  There are many doctors who will happily work with you on a super comprehensive blood test (and services like WellnessFX).  I also go out of my way to drink a lot of protein shakes, which I hate and I wouldn\u2019t do if I weren\u2019t vegetarian.\nOther stuff\nHere\u2019s what I like in a workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing that I won\u2019t be interrupted if I don\u2019t want to be, long blocks of time, and being comfortable and relaxed (I\u2019ve got a beautiful desk with a couple of 4k monitors on it in my office, but I spend almost all my time on my couch with my laptop).\nI wrote custom software for the annoying things I have to do frequently, which is great.  I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.\nLike most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with nutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times.  I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does.  And I generally try to avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice whether you care about productivity or not.\nIn general, I think it\u2019s good to overcommit a little bit.  I find that I generally get done what I take on, and if I have a little bit too much to do it makes me more efficient at everything, which is a way to train to avoid distractions (a great habit to build!).  However, overcommitting a lot is disastrous.\nDon\u2019t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity\u2014that\u2019s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you\u2019ll be less happy).

{"prompt": "Perceive the post, grasp its content, and ponder how to replicate the author's writing flair. The following article may be helpful for individuals interested in the importance of free speech and the tolerance of controversial ideas in society. It clarifies the author's previous statement and emphasizes the need for open-mindedness and the acceptance of differing viewpoints. It also discusses the role of free speech in challenging societal norms and fostering progress. TITLE: A Clarification\nI made a point in this post inelegantly in a way that was easy to misunderstand, so I\u2019d like to clarify it.\nI didn\u2019t mean that we need to tolerate brilliant homophobic jerks in the lab so that we can have scientific progress.  Although there are famous counterexamples, most of the best scientists I\u2019ve met are unusually nice, open-minded people.  Generally I expect that labs that don\u2019t tolerate jerks will produce more impressive results than the ones that do, and choosing not to employ jerks is a good idea\u2014jerks usually reduce the net output of organizations.\nWhat I meant is simply that we need, as a society, to tolerate controversial ideas.  The biggest new scientific ideas, and the most important changes to society, both start as extremely unpopular ideas.\nIt was literally heretical, not so long ago, to say that it was ok to be gay\u2014the Bible has a different viewpoint.  In a society where we don\u2019t allow challenges to the orthodoxy, gay rights would not have happened.\nWe need to allow free speech because sometimes society is wrong\u2014we needed people to be able to say \u201cgay people are ok\u201d at a time when \u201cgay people are evil\u201d was the consensus opinion.\nIt\u2019s probably impossible to design a simple set of rules that will always allow the right speech and not the wrong speech (although I am sure that in this particular case, it is wrong that gay people in some places still fear for their safety.) \nSo we agree as a society that people are allowed to say controversial things, and that free speech goes both ways.  Much of the time people use that privilege to be jerks, and we can, should, and do point out why their bigotry is bad.  Sometimes they use it to say that people deserve more rights, or that the solar system works in a different way from what the church says\u2014and sometimes we collectively listen. \nOver time, this system produces a more and more just world, which says something really good about people as a whole.\nI wish we could figure out a way to just never allow hate, discrimination, and bigotry and always allow debate on controversial but important ideas.  If that were possible, I\u2019d support it.  The distinction is usually clear, but the exceptions are sometimes critically important.  Figuring out exactly where to draw the line is really hard.\nGenerations before us believed a lot of things we now believe (correctly, in my opinion) to be unethical or wrong.  Future generations will think a lot of things we believe today are unethical or wrong. \nFor example, today it is pretty unpopular to say \u201canyone who eats meat is unethical\u201d.  But this is easily a stance I could imagine being commonplace in 50 years, because of evolving views on animal rights, impact on the planet, and availability of lab-grown replacements.  Perhaps even the arrival of AI makes us think differently about being ok eating other beings just because they\u2019re much less smart/emotionally sophisticated than we are.\nThe last time I tried to discuss this with someone, he said something like: \u201cBanning eating meat would be infringing on my rights, this is not up for discussion.\u201d \nI expect the fact that we let people live in poverty is also something that future generations will consider an absolute moral failing.  I could go on with a long list of other ideas, and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t even think of some of the most important ones.\nThe point I most wanted to make is that is that it\u2019s dangerous to just ban discussion of topics we find offensive, like what happened yesterday.

{"prompt": "Consume the post, gather its wisdom, and think about how you might write like the author. The following article may be helpful for individuals interested in discussing controversial ideas and promoting open dialogue. It discusses the importance of freedom of speech and the negative consequences of restricting ideas and innovation. It also addresses the need to tolerate diverse and unconventional ideas in order to foster creativity and breakthroughs. TITLE: E Pur Si Muove\nEarlier this year, I noticed something in China that really surprised me.  I realized I felt more comfortable discussing controversial ideas in Beijing than in San Francisco.  I didn\u2019t feel completely comfortable\u2014this was China, after all\u2014just more comfortable than at home.\nThat showed me just how bad things have become, and how much things have changed since I first got started here in 2005.\nIt seems easier to accidentally speak heresies in San Francisco every year.  Debating a controversial idea, even if you 95% agree with the consensus side, seems ill-advised.\nThis will be very bad for startups in the Bay Area.\nRestricting speech leads to restricting ideas and therefore restricted innovation\u2014the most successful societies have generally been the most open ones.  Usually mainstream ideas are right and heterodox ideas are wrong, but the true and unpopular ideas are what drive the world forward.  Also, smart people tend to have an allergic reaction to the restriction of ideas, and I\u2019m now seeing many of the smartest people I know move elsewhere.\nIt is bad for all of us when people can\u2019t say that the world is a sphere, that evolution is real, or that the sun is at the center of the solar system.\nMore recently, I\u2019ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic.  \u201cIf people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical\u201d was a memorable quote I heard this year.\nTo get the really good ideas, we need to tolerate really bad and wacky ideas too.  In addition to the work Newton is best known for, he also studied alchemy (the British authorities banned work on this because they feared the devaluation of gold) and considered himself to be someone specially chosen by the almighty for the task of decoding Biblical scripture.  \nYou can\u2019t tell which seemingly wacky ideas are going to turn out to be right, and nearly all ideas that turn out to be great breakthroughs start out sounding like terrible ideas.  So if you want a culture that innovates, you can\u2019t have a culture where you allow the concept of heresy\u2014if you allow the concept at all, it tends to spread.  When we move from strenuous debate about ideas to casting the people behind the ideas as heretics, we gradually stop debate on all controversial ideas.\nThis is uncomfortable, but it\u2019s possible we have to allow people to say disparaging things about gay people if we want them to be able to say novel things about physics. [1 Of course we can and should say that ideas are mistaken, but we can\u2019t just call the person a heretic.  We need to debate the actual idea. \nPolitical correctness often comes from a good place\u2014I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you\u2019re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won\u2019t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage.\nI don\u2019t know who Satoshi is, but I\u2019m skeptical that he, she, or they would have been able to come up with the idea for bitcoin immersed in the current culture of San Francisco\u2014it would have seemed too crazy and too dangerous, with too many ways to go wrong.  If SpaceX started in San Francisco in 2017, I assume they would have been attacked for focusing on problems of the 1%, or for doing something the government had already decided was too hard.  I can picture Galileo looking up at the sky and whispering \u201cE pur si muove\u201d here today.\n\nFollowup: A Clarification\n\n\n\n[1 I am less worried that letting some people on the internet say things like \u201cgay people are evil\u201d is going to convince reasonable people that such a statement is true than I fear losing the opposite\u2014we needed people to be free to say \"gay people are ok\" to make the progress we've made, even though it was not a generally acceptable thought several decades ago.\nIn fact, the only ideas I\u2019m afraid of letting people say are the ones that I think may be true and that I don\u2019t like.  But I accept that censorship is not going to make the world be the way I wish it were.", "completion": "This is the 18th completion"}
{"prompt": "Scan the article, assimilate the information, and think about adopting the author's writing style. The following article may be helpful for individuals interested in the potential future merging of humans and machines, as well as the impact of AI on society. It explores the concept of the \"merge\" between humans and technology, discussing the gradual process of integration and the influence of algorithms in our lives. The article also touches on the possibilities of superhuman AI, genetic enhancement, and brain-machine interfaces. It raises questions about the co-evolution of humans and AI and the potential conflicts that may arise. TITLE: The Merge\nA popular topic in Silicon Valley is talking about what year humans and machines will merge (or, if not, what year humans will get surpassed by rapidly improving AI or a genetically enhanced species). Most guesses seem to be between 2025 and 2075.\nPeople used to call this the singularity; now it feels uncomfortable and real enough that many seem to avoid naming it at all.\nPerhaps another reason people stopped using the word \u201csingularity\u201d is that it implies a single moment in time, and it now looks like the merge is going to be a gradual process. And gradual processes are hard to notice.\nI believe the merge has already started, and we are a few years in. Our phones control us and tell us what to do when; social media feeds determine how we feel; search engines decide what we think.\nThe algorithms that make all this happen are no longer understood by any one person. They optimize for what their creators tell them to optimize for, but in ways that no human could figure out\u200a\u2014\u200athey are what today seems like sophisticated AI, and tomorrow will seem like child\u2019s play. And they\u2019re extremely effective\u200a\u2014\u200aat least speaking for myself, I have a very hard time resisting what the algorithms want me to do. Until I made a real effort to combat it, I found myself getting extremely addicted to the internet. [1\nWe are already in the phase of co-evolution\u200a\u2014\u200athe AIs affect, effect, and infect us, and then we improve the AI. We build more computing power and run the AI on it, and it figures out how to build even better chips.\nThis probably cannot be stopped. As we have learned, scientific advancement eventually happens if the laws of physics do not prevent it.\nMore important than that, unless we destroy ourselves first, superhuman AI is going to happen, genetic enhancement is going to happen, and brain-machine interfaces are going to happen. It is a failure of human imagination and human arrogance to assume that we will never build things smarter than ourselves.\nOur self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing.\nThe merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it\u2014in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond\u2014they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.\nAlthough the merge has already begun, it\u2019s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.\nIt\u2019s probably going to happen sooner than most people think. Hardware is improving at an exponential rate\u2014the most surprising thing I\u2019ve learned working on OpenAI is just how correlated increasing computing power and AI breakthroughs are\u2014and the number of smart people working on AI is increasing exponentially as well. Double exponential functions get away from you fast.\nIt would be good for the entire world to start taking this a lot more seriously now. Worldwide coordination doesn\u2019t happen quickly, and we need it for this.\n\n\n[1 I believe attention hacking is going to be the sugar epidemic of this generation. I can feel the changes in my own life\u200a\u2014\u200aI can still wistfully remember when I had an attention span. My friends\u2019 young children don\u2019t even know that\u2019s something they should miss. I am angry and unhappy more often, but I channel it into productive change less often, instead chasing the dual dopamine hits of likes and outrage.\n(Cross-posted from https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/merge-now-430c6d89d1fe to here for consistency; thanks to Medium for inviting me to write this!)", "completion": "This is the 19th completion"}
{"prompt": "View the post, learn from its insights, and reflect on how to mirror the author's style in your writing The following article may be helpful for individuals interested in economic policy and wealth distribution. It discusses the idea of every adult US citizen receiving an annual share of the US GDP as a means to create a fair and inclusive system. The article explores the potential benefits of this approach, such as aligning everyone's interests in the country's success and providing more opportunities for individuals to achieve their desired life. It also addresses the challenges and considerations that would need to be taken into account when implementing such a program. TITLE: American Equity\nI\u2019d like feedback on the following idea.\nI think that every adult US citizen should get an annual share of the US GDP.\nI believe that owning something like a share in America would align all of us in making the country as successful as possible\u2014the better the country does, the better everyone does\u2014and give more people a fair shot at achieving the life they want.  And we all work together to create the system that generates so much prosperity.\nI believe that a new social contract like what I\u2019m suggesting here\u2014where we agree to a floor and no ceiling\u2014would lead to a huge increase in US prosperity and keep us in the global lead.  Countries that concentrate wealth in a small number of families do worse over the long term\u2014if we don\u2019t take a radical step toward a fair, inclusive system, we will not be the leading country in the world for much longer.  This would harm all Americans more than most realize.\nThere are historical examples of countries giving out land to citizens (such as the Homestead Acts in the US) as a way to distribute the resources people needed to succeed.  Today, the fundamental input to wealth generation isn\u2019t farmland, but money and ideas\u2014you really do need money to make money.\nAmerican Equity would also cushion the transition from the jobs of today to the jobs of tomorrow.  Automation holds the promise of creating more abundance than we ever dreamed possible, but it\u2019s going to significantly change how we think about work.  If everyone benefits more directly from economic growth, then it will be easier to move faster toward this better world.\nThe default case for automation is to concentrate wealth (and therefore power) in a tiny number of hands.  America has repeatedly found ways to challenge this sort of concentration, and we need to do so again.\nThe joint-stock company was one of the most important inventions in human history.  It allowed us to align a lot of people in pursuit of a common goal and accomplish things no individual could.  Obviously, the US is not a company, but I think a similar model can work for the US as well as it does for companies.\nA proposal like this obviously requires a lot of new funding [1 to do at large scale, but I think we could start very small\u2014a few hundred dollars per citizen per year\u2014and ramp it up to a long-term target of 10-20% of GDP per year when the GDP per capita doubles.\nI have no delusions about the challenges of such a program.  There would be difficult consequences for things like immigration policy that will need a lot of discussion.  We\u2019d also need to figure out rules about transferability and borrowing against this equity.  And we\u2019d need to set it up in a way that does not exacerbate short-term thinking or favor unsustainable growth.\nHowever, as the economy grows, we could imagine a world in which every American would have their basic needs guaranteed.  Absolute poverty would be eliminated, and we would no longer motivate people through the fear of not being able to eat.  In addition to being the obviously right thing to do, eliminating poverty will increase productivity.\nAmerican Equity would create a society that I believe would work much better than what we have today.  It would free Americans to work on what they really care about, improve social cohesion, and incentivize everyone to think about ways to grow the whole pie.\n \n[1 It\u2019s time to update our tax system for the way wealth works in the modern world\u2014for example, taxing capital and labor at the same rates.  And we should consider eventually replacing some of our current aid programs, which distort incentives and are needlessly complicated and inefficient, with something like this.\nOf course this won\u2019t solve all our problems\u2014we still need serious reform in areas such as housing, education, and healthcare.  Without policies that address the cost of living crisis, any sort of redistribution will be far less effective than it otherwise could be.", "completion": "This is the 20th completion"}

The article emphasizes the need for a dedicated problem solver and a chief optimist in a founding team. TITLE: Greg\nA lot of people ask me what the ideal cofounder looks like.  I now have an answer: Greg Brockman.\nEvery successful startup I know has at least one person who provides the force of will to make the startup happen.  I\u2019d thought a lot about this in the abstract while advising YC startups, but until OpenAI I hadn\u2019t observed up close someone else drive the formation of a startup.\nOpenAI wouldn\u2019t have happened without Greg.  He commits quickly and fully to things.  I organized a group dinner early on to talk about what such an organization might look like, and drove him home afterwards.  Greg asked me questions for the first half of the drive back to San Francisco, then declared he was in, and started planning logistics for the rest of the drive.\nFrom then on he was fully in, with an average email response time of about 5 minutes to anything.  Elon and I were both busy with day jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a very high-latency connection.\nHe recruited the founding team.  Greg is a world-class recruiter (he plans every detail of interviews, heavily researches candidate\u2019s backgrounds, sends thoughtful and persistent followups, and so on), and I now believe even more strongly that someone on the founding team has to be an amazing recruiter.\nHe\u2019s incredibly open to feedback.  Large or small, he\u2019s always willing to hear it, never gets offended, and processes it very quickly.  I once suggested to him that he wasn't communicating a bold enough vision for the organization, and the next time I heard him talk about it (and every time since) it was a perfectly calibrated explanation of how we were going to succeed at something that really mattered.  Even on non-traditional ideas, like when I suggested he co-lead the organization with Ilya, he was always open-minded and thoughtful.\nGreg also played the role of \u2018non-technical cofounder\u2019, which is a misnomer because most people who know him will say something like \u201cGreg is the most productive engineer I know\u201d.

Founding teams need a Chief Optimist to rally everyone to press on despite the difficulties, and it\u2019s always hard on that person because they can\u2019t really lean on anyone else in the hardest times.\nYou for sure need great technical talent on a founding team, but make sure you also have someone like Greg.

It provides insights from conversations with 100 Trump voters, discussing their likes and dislikes about the president, their concerns, and their thoughts on the left's response. It aims to shed light on the diversity of Trump supporters and emphasizes the importance of listening and understanding different viewpoints. TITLE: What I Heard From Trump Supporters\nAfter the election, I decided to talk to 100 Trump voters from around the country.  I went to the middle of the country, the middle of the state, and talked to many online.\nThis was a surprisingly interesting and helpful experience\u2014I highly recommend it.  With three exceptions, I found something to like about everyone I talked to (though I strongly disagreed with many of the things they said).  Although it shouldn\u2019t have surprised me given the voting data, I was definitely surprised by the diversity of the people I spoke to\u2014I did not expect to talk to so many Muslims, Mexicans, Black people, and women in the course of this project.\nAlmost everyone I asked was willing to talk to me, but almost none of them wanted me to use their names\u2014even people from very red states were worried about getting \u201ctargeted by those people in Silicon Valley if they knew I voted for him\u201d.  One person in Silicon Valley even asked me to sign a confidentiality agreement before she would talk to me, as she worried she\u2019d lose her job if people at her company knew she was a strong Trump supporter. \nI wanted to understand what Trump voters liked and didn\u2019t like about the president, what they were nervous about, what they thought about the left\u2019s response so far, and most importantly, what would convince them not to vote for him in the future. \nObviously, this is not a poll, and not \u2018data\u2019.  But I think narratives are really important.\nHere\u2019s what I heard.\nThe TL;DR quote is this:\n\u201cYou all can defeat Trump next time, but not if you keep mocking us, refusing to listen to us, and cutting us out.  It\u2019s Republicans, not Democrats, who will take Trump down.\u201d\n  What do you like about Trump?\n\u201cHe is not politically correct.\u201d Note: This sentiment came up a lot, probably in at least a third of the conversations I had.\n\u201cHe says true but unpopular things.  If you can\u2019t talk about problems, you can\u2019t fix them.\u201d\n\u201cI'm a Jewish libertarian who's [sic grandparents were Holocaust survivors.  Over the last few years the mainstream left has resorted to name-calling and character assassination, instead of debate, any time their positions are questioned.  This atmosphere became extremely oppressive and threatening to people, like myself, who disagreed with many of Obama's policies over the past several years.  Intelligent debate has become rare.\u201d\n\u201cIt's a lot like political discussion was in Soviet Union, actually.  I think the inability to acknowledge obvious truths, and the ever-increasing scope of these restrictions makes it particularly frustrating.  And personally, for whatever reason, I find inability to have more subtle discussion very frustrating--things are not white or black, but you can't talk about greys since the politically correct answer is white.\u201d\n\u201cHe is anti-abortion.\u201d Note: This sentiment came up a lot.  A number of people I spoke to said they didn\u2019t care about anything else he did and would always vote for whichever candidate was more anti-abortion.\n\u201cI like that he puts the interests of Americans first.  American policy needs to be made from a position of how Americans benefit from it, as that is the role of government.\u201d\n\u201cHe is anti-immigration.\u201d Note: This sentiment came up a lot.  The most surprising takeaway for me how little it seemed to be driven by economic concerns, and how much it was driven by fears about \u201closing our culture\u201d, \u201csafety\u201d, \u201ccommunity\u201d, and a general Us-vs.-Them mentality. \n\u201cHe will preserve our culture.  Preservation of culture is considered good in most cases.  What\u2019s wrong with preserving the good parts of American culture?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Mexican.  I support the wall.  The people who have stayed have destroyed Mexico, and now they want to get out and cause damage here.  We need to protect our borders, but now any policy is like that is called racist.  Trump was the first person willing to say that out loud.\u201d\n\u201cI am socially very liberal.  I am fiscally very conservative.  I don't feel I have a party--never have.  I grew up in a more socially conservative time and picked the \"lesser of two evils\" during elections.  Now, the more socially liberal side supports bigger governments, more aid and support and that money has to come from somewhere.  I see what's deducted from my check each week.  I'm OK with never being rich but I'd like more security and that doesn't come from more government spending.\u201d\n\u201cWe need borders at every level of our society.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to postpone some further social justice progress, which doesn\u2019t really result in loss of life, in favor of less foreign policy involvement, the opposite of which does.\" \n\u201cBrown people are always the out-crowd.  I think subconsciously, part of the reason I supported him was a way to be in the in-crowd for once.\u201d\n  What don\u2019t you like about him? \n\u201cThe way he talks about women is despicable.\u201d\n\u201cEverything about his style.  We only voted for him because this election was too important to worry about style.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like most things about him.  The way it worked is we got to choose one of two terrible options.\u201d\n\u201cI think our nation needs Trumpism to survive long term, and to me that supersedes almost every other reservation I have.  My issue is with Trump himself--I think he's the wrong vessel for his movement, but he's all we've got so I'm behind him.\u201d \n\u201cI think the rollout of the immigration executive order is emblematic of a clusterfuck, to be completely frank.\u201d\n\u201cI now believe the Muslim ban actually makes us less safe.\u201d\n\u201cIsolationism and protectionism at this point is insane. We've done that before.\u201d\n\u201cI, too, worry about the dishonesty.  His relationship with Russia, his relationship with women.  His relationship with questionable financial matters.  These all worry me and were they to continue I would lose all respect.\u201d\n\u201cHe continually plays into a character that he has created to rile his fan base. Accepting anti-semitism, white nationalism, or hate emanating unnecessarily, creates a vacuum of fear on social media, on television, and around the dinner table.  Even though the policies may be similar to that of any recent Republican President, the behavior to act so immaturely sets a bad example for children and undercuts many cultural norms, which more than anything causes disruption to our sociological foundations.\u201d\n\u201cI hate that he discredits the press all the time.  That seems to forebode great evil.\u201d\n  What are you nervous about with Trump as president?\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019m most worried about is war, and that he could destroy the whole world.  I think I may have underestimated that risk, because he is more of an alpha strongman that I realized when I voted for him.  Otherwise I still like him.\u201d Note: Most people weren\u2019t that worried about war.  More frequent comments were along these lines: \n\u201cI know he\u2019s taking strong positions on certain foreign issues, but I feel in negotiations you need to do things to move the needle and when a whole country is watching its hard to keep a poker face, but at least his business track record overall gives us reason to believe ultimately stability will prevail.\u201d\nand\n\u201cHe\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s a tactic to get other nations not to mess with us.\u201d\n\u201cI worry he will drive us apart as a nation.  I believed him when he said that would stop with the campaign, but I haven\u2019t seen signs of it so far.\u201d\n\u201cI am nervous that his mental health is actually bad.\u201d\n\u201cI worry he is actually going to roll back social change we\u2019ve fought so hard for.  But I hope not.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about the left\u2019s response so far? \n\u201cYou need to give us an opportunity to admit we may have been wrong without saying we\u2019re bad people.  I am already thinking I made a mistake, but I feel ostracized from my community.\u201d \n\u201cThe left is more intolerant than the right.\u201d  Note: This concept came up a lot, with real animosity in otherwise pleasant conversations.\n\u201cStop calling us racists.  Stop calling us idiots.  We aren\u2019t.  Listen to us when we try to tell you why we aren\u2019t.  Oh, and stop making fun of us.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love to see one-tenth of the outrage about the state of our lives out here that you have for Muslims from another country.   You have no idea what our lives are like.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired of hearing about white privilege.  I\u2019m white, but way less privileged than a black person from your world.  I have no hope my life will ever get any better.\u201d\n\u201cI am tired of feeling silenced and demonized.  We have mostly the same goals, and different opinions about how to get there.  Maybe I\u2019m wrong, maybe you\u2019re wrong.  But enough with calling all of us the devil for wanting to try Trump.  I hate Hillary and think she wants to destroy the country of us but I don\u2019t demonize her supporters.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m angry that they\u2019re so outraged now, but were never outraged over an existing terrible system.\u201d\n\u201cThe attacks against Trump have taught me something about myself. I have defended him and said things I really didn't believe or support because I was put in a defensive position. Protesters may have pushed many people in this direction BUT it is ultimately our responsibility and must stop.\u201d\n\u201cI'd like to also add that the demonization of Trump by calling him and his supporters: Nazis, KKK, white supremacists, fascists, etc. works very well in entrenching Trump supporters on his side.  These attacks are counter-factual and in my opinion very helpful to Trump.\u201d \n\u201cSo far his election has driven our nation apart.  So far I see most of the divisiveness coming from the left.  Shame on them.  I don't see it quite as bad as during Nixon's era but we are truly headed in that direction.  I could not speak with my parents during that time because political division would intrude.  This Thanksgiving and holiday season were as close as I've felt to that in 40 years.  We are increasingly polarized.  It doesn't seem to be strictly generational, though that exists.  There is an east coast-west coast, rural vs. urban, racial, and gender division forming now.  It has the potential to be devastating.\u201d \n\u201cThe amount of violent attacks and economic attacks perpetrated by the left are troublesome.  My wife and I recently moved to the Bay Area.  I was expecting a place which was a welcoming meritocracy of ideas.  Instead, I found a place where everyone constantly watches everyone else for any thoughtcrime.\u201d \n\u201cSilicon Valley is incredibly unwelcoming to alternative points of view.  Your curiosity, if it is sincere, is the very rare exception to the rule.\u201d\n\u201cThere is something hypocritical about the left saying the are uniters not dividers, they are inclusive and then excluding half the population with comments on intelligence and irrelevance in the modern world.\u201d\n  What would convince you not to vote for him again?\n\u201cWar would be unforgivable.\u201d\n\u201cIf the Russia thing were true, I\u2019d turn against him.  Why don\u2019t y\u2019all focus on that instead of his tweets?\u201d\n\u201cGive us a better option, and we\u2019ll be happy.  But it needs to be a moderate\u2014Sanders won\u2019t win.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll happily vote for someone else.  There\u2019s a lot I hate about Trump.  But our lives are basically destroyed, and he was the first person to talk about fixing that.\u201d\n\u201cGenerally hard to say.  Extreme corruption would do it.\u201d\nSecond person in the same conversation: \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s corrupt.  Y\u2019all voted for Hillary and she was the most corrupt candidate of all time.\u201d\n\u201cAnother worry is an escalation of overreaches between him and the left that culminates in the breakdown of our system of law.  I'd hold him responsible for that.\u201d\n\u201cIf he were to get the US involved in a major military conflict (I think the odds of this have actually decreased versus Hillary, but I'm willing to be proven wrong). If he were to substantially increase the cost of doing business (by increasing regulation or taxes for instance).\u201d\n\u201cI'm socially very liberal. If he were to do something like restart a war on drugs, try to restrict rights of LGBT, or make first trimester abortions difficult or dangerous, I'd rethink my position.  I think these type of things are extremely unlikely though, especially with an election a few years away the country as a whole becoming more socially liberal.\u201d\n\u201cI think if 2008 happened again (further into Trump's tenure, so that causation can be shown, hypothetically), the base would evaporate.\u201d \n\u201cBased on Trump's history before politics I don't believe he is racist, sexist, homophobic or bigoted.  If that were true it would supersede everything else since it would be even worse for individual liberty and freedom than any freedom of speech restrictions or increases in government size proposed by the Democratic Party.\u201d", "completion": "This is the 27th completion"}
{"prompt": "Look over the article, learn its messages, and ponder how to emulate the author's writing technique. <<UNDER 500 WORDS>> The following article may be helpful for entrepreneurs or individuals interested in startups. It discusses the trend of successful companies bridging the gap between the online and physical worlds. The article explores the concept of connecting real-life experiences with online platforms, highlighting the success of companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook. It also suggests that companies that solely exist in either the online or physical world may not perform as well. The article provides insights into the importance of incorporating real-world interactions into online businesses and offers examples and considerations for entrepreneurs looking to start new ventures. TITLE: Electrons and Atoms\nA friend recently asked me for my list of current breakout companies.  I made it, and noticed that all of them had only one thing in common.  I then went back through the last three YC batches and looked at our top-ranked companies (although we get it wrong plenty of times, it\u2019s reasonably predictive).  These companies had the same trait. \nThis shared trait is a connection between the online and the physical worlds.  There are two main models for this\u2014the Uber model, where you push a button on a website/app and something happens in the real world, and the Airbnb model, where you use a service to do something in the real world that would be possible but extremely inefficient.  In both cases, the key thing is enabling users to do things they do in real life much more easily\u2014yes, you could have called a cab company, but it took a long time, the cab didn\u2019t always come, you didn\u2019t know when it was near, you had to have cash or get a nasty look from the cabbie, etc.\nEven Facebook is a lightweight version of this\u2014with Facebook, you bring your real world online so you can interface with it more often, more easily, and from anywhere.  Facebook has obviously been much more successful than services like SecondLife, which were entirely virtual, and services MySpace, which were less about real identity and real friends.  Amazon was perhaps the original example of bridging these two worlds.\nAs a corollary, new companies that exist only in the real or online world do not seem to do as well as companies that connect them.  This happens more often on the online side than the physical side, both because we generally don\u2019t think of things like barbershops as startups and because most people don\u2019t expect pure hardware companies without a strong Internet component to do very well.  And this bridge is often a matter of degree\u2014many, if not most, online companies touch the real world in some way.  But the ones that do it the most seem to be doing better.\nIn many ways, this is a version of Marc Andreessen\u2019s \u201csoftware is eating the world\u201d.  To eat the world, you have to operate in the world.  I think two big reasons it\u2019s happening so much now are 1) smartphones are in everyone\u2019s hands and 2) there is a level of personal comfort with putting real life on the internet that seems to have tipped about two years ago.\nThere are probably a lot of areas where this doesn\u2019t apply\u2014enterprise software and developer tools, for instance\u2014and there are clear counterexamples like Google.  But as a general rule, it seems to be worth considering when thinking about new businesses.", "completion": "This is the 28th completion"}
{"prompt": "Glance through the post, learn and absorb, and consider how you could mirror the author's style in your writing. The following article may be helpful for individuals who are concerned about the actions taken by President Trump's administration, particularly in relation to immigration policies. It discusses the need for tech companies to take a stand against these actions and speak up for the rights of immigrants. The article also emphasizes the importance of not demonizing Trump voters and the potential impact of employees pushing their companies to take action. TITLE: Time to Take a Stand\nIt is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump\u2019s administration.\nThere are many actions from his first week that are objectionable.  In repeatedly invoking unsubstantiated conspiracy theories (like the 3 million illegal votes), he's delegitimizing his opponents and continuing to damage our society.  So much objectionable action makes it hard to know where and when to focus, and outrage fatigue is an effective strategy.\nBut the executive order from yesterday titled \u201cProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\u201d is tantamount to a Muslim ban and requires objection.  I am obviously in favor of safety and rules, but broad-strokes actions targeted at a specific religious group is the wrong solution, and a first step toward a further reduction in rights.\nIn addition, the precedent of invalidating already-issued visas and green cards should be extremely troubling for immigrants of any country or for anyone who thinks their contributions to the US are important.  This is not just a Muslim ban.  This is a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation.\nThis administration has already shown that they are not particularly impressed by the first amendment, and that they are interested in other anti-immigrant action.  So we must object, or our inaction will send a message that the administration can continue to take away our rights.  \nIn doing so, we should not demonize Trump voters\u2014most of them voted for him for reasons other than the promise of a Muslim ban.  We need their eventual support in resisting actions like these, and we will not get it if we further isolate them. \nThe tech community is powerful.  Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard.  We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally.  Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers\u2014if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.\nTech companies go to extraordinary lengths to recruit and retain employees; those employees have a lot of leverage.  If employees push companies to do something, I believe they\u2019ll have to.  \nAt a minimum, companies should take a public stance.  But talking is only somewhat effective, and employees should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take.  I wish I had better ideas here, but we\u2019re going to have a meeting on Friday at Y Combinator to discuss.  I\u2019d love to see other tech companies do the same. \nIf this action has not crossed a line for you, I suggest you think now about what your own line in the sand is.  It\u2019s easy, with gradual escalation, for the definition of \u2018acceptable\u2019 to get moved.  So think now about what action President Trump might take that you would consider crossing a line, and write it down.  \nAlmost every member of the GOP I have spoken to knows that these actions are wrong.  Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Kevin McCarthy and James Mattis said so themselves when Trump first proposed his Muslim ban.  We need to remind anyone involved in this administration that, for the rest of their lives, they will have to explain why they were complicit in this. \nIn my first post on Trump last June, I said it would be a good time for all of us to start speaking up.  We are now at the stage where something is starting that is going to be taught in history classes, and not in a good way.  This morning, Kellyanne Conway posted on Twitter that Trump is \"a man of action\" who is \"just getting started\".  I believe her.  We must now start speaking up.", "completion": "This is the 29th completion"}
{"prompt": "Study the post, grasp its essence, and reflect on how to adopt the author's approach to writing. The following article may be helpful for individuals who are interested in understanding the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on entrepreneurs and startup founders. It discusses how the ACA has provided support and access to healthcare for individuals who may not have been able to start their own companies otherwise. The article includes personal stories from founders who benefited from the ACA and emphasizes the importance of preserving affordable healthcare options for entrepreneurs. TITLE: Affordable Care\nThe Affordable Care Act is far from perfect\u2013for one thing, I think health insurance should be entirely separate from employment\u2013but I hate the thought of losing it without a replacement for people who will lose insurance. If Congress ends up repealing it, I hope they earnestly try to preserve the best parts, and put in place something better.\nOne thing the ACA definitely did was help a lot of founders start their companies--without it, being a founder would make sense for less people. The Department of Health and Human Services released a lot of new data yesterday showing how the ACA helped support entrepreneurs, and in light of that, I thought it would be good to collect and share stories of how the ACA helped some Y Combinator founders get started.\nHere they are in the founders\u2019 own words:\nDan Carroll, Clever, S12\nMarch 3, 2012: I'm holed up in a hotel room in San Francisco with two of my best friends, wildly excited about the idea that will become Clever. We've packed the day with difficult conversations \u2013 Where will the company be founded? Do we have enough savings? Who will be CEO? \u2013 but the only topic that I'm truly afraid of is health. I've been living with Crohn's Disease for nearly ten years, and I know that without health care, I'd die, and without health insurance, I'd go broke. But some quick research tells me that, thanks to the ACA, I can join my parents' healthcare plan until I turn 26 the following January. Risk mitigated, I make the commitment to my cofounders - I'm in.\n\nEthan Perlstein, Perlara, W16\nI left academia on Jan 1, 2013 as unemployed former postdoc. I would not have been able to move across the country to start my company, and my wife wouldn't have given up her employer-sponsored health insurance, if not for Obamacare. Also, some of the first employees at Perlara depended on the ACA for insurance.\n\nRandall Bennett, VidPresso, W14\nThere's a good chance that without the aca my startup wouldn't exist... or I'd be dead. When launching my startup we couldn't get health insurance because one insurer denied us because I once had a sleep study for sleep apnea. Once you get one rejection, all the others reject you.\nThen, last year I had a brain tumor. I had moved off to a more normal health plan... but with the last set of rules chances are it'd have been unlikely I could have gotten any insurance, let alone a somewhat reasonable plan.\n\nBen Maitland-Lewis, Pretty Instant, W15\nWe aren't yet at a stage where we can offer healthcare to our employees but thanks to the ACA we are all individually insured. This has been instrumental in helping us grow the business while keeping costs low. I hope the next administration doesn't repeal our access to individualized affordable healthcare as it would have a direct effect on the company at this stage.\n\nRavi Parikh, Heap, W13\nThe provision in ACA that allows young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance until they're 26 has helped me multiple times. In 2011, I was self-employed as a musician, which would have been much more difficult to pursue if I weren't able to take advantage of my parents' health insurance. Later, my co-founder Matin left his job at Facebook in 2012. He and I worked on a number of side projects, one of which eventually became Heap. Both him and I remained on our parents' insurance until Heap had enough funding and traction to offer health plans to employees. Again, without being able to remain on our parents' insurance, this would have been much more difficult.\n\nMike Romano, Lendsnap, S16\nThe ACA has been a blessing for me and my family, and without it, I could not pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I began my new career within days of the birth of my son, and the fact he arrived five weeks early only complicated plans further. My wife is a graphic designer and usually only finds contract work without benefits. The ACA allows me to follow my passion of transforming the mortgage industry while ensuring our son gets the crucial care he needs during his early life.\n\nBrian Merritt, Seed, W15\nFor me, the ACA was life changing. Prior to the ACA I was only able to obtain insurance either through an established group plan, or via Medical/Medicaid \u201clast resort\u201d insurance. This was because I have a pre-existing condition that made me ineligible to buy an individual insurance plan. Due to having a chronic condition that needs to be managed carefully, having a quality insurance plan was not an option, but a requirement. So my only option was to work for a large employer with an established health plan that would provide me with the appropriate benefits to support my situation. After the ACA made it so that pre-existing conditions don\u2019t disqualify applicants, I was able to purchase an individual insurance plan outside of my employer, and as as a result I was able to start a company and work on it for almost two years before we were able to put our own group plan together.\n\nMick Johnson, Whereoscope, S10\nThe ACA was essential when starting my new business - I founded the company, was pre-funding for 9 months, and the only employee, so was unable to get small group coverage. I have a wife, a child, and another child on the way so health insurance was essential. Without the ACA I could never have left a regular job to found this new company, which has now raised funding and employs 7 people.\n\nKevin Law, Cambly, W14\nI had to apply for individual health care twice while starting Cambly before the ACA exchanges launched at the end of 2013. It was incredibly difficult and expensive, because I had to keep paying for expensive COBRA coverage from my previous employer while repeatedly applying, appealing, and getting rejected by insurers for individual plans. I was still on a group plan during the ACA debates and assumed that the only people getting rejected were the chronically ill. I learned through my experience that nearly anyone who had past health care expenses would often be rejected when applying for individual plans (as was my case).\nAn especially ironic moment occurred when I was on a Blue Cross group plan via COBRA and appealing a rejection for a Blue Cross individual plan. I got a physical, so my doctor could write a letter saying I was in good health for the appeal. I simultaneously received a rejection letter for my individual plan appeal citing pasts health costs AND a letter from my group plan asking if the physical was related to a workplace incident (presumably so they could sue someone to get reimbursed for the costs).\nThe exchanges finally went live at the end of 2013, and I quickly got insurance coverage. No extensive health history paperwork. No rejections or appeals. It launched right around when we got into YC, so it was great to focus on building and growing our business rather than trying to obtain health insurance.\n\nTristan Tao, Leada, S15\nI'm currently 24 years old (going on 25). I am fortunately covered under my parent's health insurance under ACA (until I'm 26). This was critical in reducing my personal burn. I would not go without health insurance; this meant I'd have to either join a larger company to gain coverage, or purchase them out of pocket. Either way it would've significantly hindered the 22 yrs old me to start a company as a Senior in College.\nI strongly hope that the successor of Obamacare will include a clause that makes it cheaper for recent graduates to get coverage (or retain the current policy of enabling people younger than 26 to stay on their parents' coverage).\nLooking back, the largest hindrance to starting a company would've been debt (which I didn't have any), and personal burn (insurance being a huge part).\n\nRam Jayaraman, PlateIQ, S15\n5 out of 7 members of the initial team at Plate IQ were on ACA. Without ACA in the early days we would have to spend large amounts on employer health insurance and since the team was small we would not have gotten much discounts either. Since the team just needed something basic until we raise decent venture money, they were all able to find very affordable options with good networks like Kaiser.\nIn thinking of an ACA successor: very few plans are coupled with HSA accounts and HSA withdrawals are penalized. For startups with young teams I would ideally like to continue getting plans with large deductibles and large co-pays and instead contribute to an HSA account. Avoiding the 20% penalty for the HSA withdrawal would definitely encourage more participation.\n\nBen Thompson, Gitprime, W16\nI have a family of 5. Had it not been for the affordable care act, it would have been incredibly difficult to take the leap to become a co-founder. Because of the ACA, I was able to take a calculated career risk without having to sacrifice health coverage for my family as part of that decision. Two years later, we\u2019ve built a company that provides benefits for all of our employees and their dependents.\n\nBrendan Lim, Kicksend, S11\nIn 2009 my wife was in a life threatening car accident. After her recovery, she was unable to get reasonably priced coverage due to her new \"pre-existing conditions\". During this time, my co-founder and I had quit our jobs and started working on Kicksend (S11) and were living off of our savings. As a result, we were unable to afford reasonable insurance. The ACA removed the \"pre-existing conditions\" and gave us peace of mind since my wife was finally able to get covered.\n\nVishal Joshi, Joy, S16\nWhen we started Joy, we had insurance as dependents and did not need to create company healthcare offer for a bit.  But soon we had a new employee very eager to join Joy but needed health insurance.  We agreed to start the process but it so happens that the entire ordeal to get company healthcare setup takes a couple of months.  If not for ACA, Joy would had lost a really good employee who is still with us and actually helped us build our website.  She was able to keep afloat using ACA while we got our company policy setup.\n\nJason Chen, Verge Genomics, S15\nThe Affordable Care Act makes it easy for us to purchase and manage health insurance plans \u2013 all of our employees are covered rapidly with no medical underwriting. However, we pay high premiums, incur rising deductibles, and plans are bloated with benefits we cannot use. We have also had to pay for \"retroactive coverage\" for some employees to avoid penalties from the individual mandate, even though no services were used. Future patient-centered health reform should facilitate access to coverage for small business and individuals while allowing greater customization of benefits.\n\nZachary Garbow, SocialBrowse, W08\nWhen I began working on my startup full time, my wife and I wanted to start a family. At that time, when trying to purchase private insurance being pregnant was considered a pre-existing condition. My wife also had undertaken some preventative procedures years earlier, which made it difficult to obtain coverage. As a result, we were stressed and anxious about not being able to get coverage, and fearful that we'd not be covered for our pregnancy and I'd have to quit my startup to find a corporate job with health insurance. Luckily, the ACA passed just in time to provide us the peace of mind to both start our family and continue building my startup. We now have 2 kids and a thriving, growing business.\n\nVarun Aroroa, OpenCurriculum, W14\nACA has allowed me to have health insurance. Before I got on Obamacare, I had no insurance and had stopped all physical activity beyond basic exercise for years, being too scared to hurt myself. Living below the adjusted poverty line, I just can't afford normal plans. It is amazing how much mental comfort and freedom it can bring in life.\n\nMike Knoop, Zapier, S12\nThanks to the ACA and my parents, the provision to cover dependents through the age of 26 enabled me to take more risk starting Zapier. Specifically, I did not have to worry about healthcare coverage when the company was small and could not afford health benefits. Now, Zapier provides health benefit coverage to our 50+ US employees.\n\nZachariah Reitano, Shout, S14\nI had heart surgery when I was 18. I was virtually uninsurable. I now have health insurance. Why we need the ACA is no more complicated than that.", "completion": "This is the 30th completion"}
{"prompt": "Engage with the article, understand its teachings, and mull over how to write in a similar style to the author. The following article may be helpful for individuals who are interested in the 2016 election or are looking for information on the endorsements made by prominent figures. It discusses the author's endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president and their reasons for doing so. The article also touches on the potential consequences of a Trump presidency and the importance of engaging in political dialogue and understanding different perspectives. TITLE: The 2016 Election\nI am endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.  I've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but I'm making an exception this year, because this election is exceptional.  Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America, and voting for Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it.\nA Trump presidency would be a disaster for the American economy.  He has no real plan to restore economic growth.\nHis racist, isolationist policies would divide our country, and American innovation would suffer.  But the man himself is even more dangerous than his policies.  He's erratic, abusive, and prone to fits of rage.\nHe represents a real threat to the safety of women, minorities, and immigrants, and I believe this reason alone more than disqualifies him to be president.  My godson\u2019s father, who is Mexican by birth and fears being deported or worse, is who convinced me to spend a significant amount of time working on this election at the beginning of this year, when Trump still seemed like an unlikely possibility.\nTrump shows little respect for the Constitution, the Republic, or for human decency, and I fear for national security if he becomes our president.\nThe only two vocal Trump supporters I am close to are Peter Thiel and my grandma.  Peter is a part-time partner at YC, meaning he spends a small fraction of his time advising YC companies, does not have a vote in how YC is run, and in his case waives the equity part-time partners normally get.\nThis has been a strain on my relationship with both of them\u2014I think they are completely wrong in their support of this man.  Though I don\u2019t ascribe all positions of a politician to his or her supporters, I do not understand how one continues to support someone who brags about sexual assault, calls for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US, or any number or other disqualifying statements.  I will continue to try to change both of their minds.\nSome have said that YC should terminate its relationship with Peter over this.  But as repugnant as Trump is to many of us, we are not going to fire someone over his or her support of a political candidate.  As far as we know, that would be unprecedented for supporting a major party nominee, and a dangerous path to start down (of course, if Peter said some of the things Trump says himself, he would no longer be part of Y Combinator).  \nThe way we got into a situation with Trump as a major party nominee in the first place was by not talking to people who are very different than we are.  The polarization of the country into two parallel political realities is not good for any of us.  We should listen to each other more, not less.\nWe should all feel a duty to try to understand the roughly half of the country that thinks we are severely misguided.  I don\u2019t understand how 43% of the country supports Trump.  But I\u2019d like to find out, because we have to include everyone in our path forward.  If our best ideas are to stop talking to or fire anyone who disagrees with us, we\u2019ll be facing this whole situation again in 2020.\nThat kind of diversity is painful and unpopular, but it is critical to health of a democratic and pluralistic society.  We shouldn\u2019t start purging people for supporting the wrong political candidate.  That's not how things are done in this country.", "completion": "This is the 31st completion"}
